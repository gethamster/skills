## The Task Loop

**Batch small same-shape work.** When the plan lists several tasks that are
each a small, independent edit of the same kind — the same one-line fix,
constant change, or field addition repeated across files — do not dispatch
one subagent per task. Compose ONE dispatch brief listing every file and
its change, send the whole batch to a single subagent, and review its diff
as one unit. Reserve one-dispatch-per-task for work that needs its own
judgment, its own tests, or its own review surface.

Everything you paste into a dispatch prompt — and everything a subagent
prints back — stays resident in your context for the rest of the session
and is re-read on every later turn. Hand artifacts over as files.

**Waiting on dispatched subagents:** never poll a wait interface with
short timeouts, and never sit in one silent, open-ended wait either.
While you have local work — ledger updates, packaging the next review,
reading reports — keep working; child results arrive on their own.
When you are genuinely idle, wait in bounded stretches (five to ten
minutes, where your platform allows), and between stretches post one
line of status and reconcile your live children: list them, and chase
any that finished without reporting. A bounded stretch keeps nearly
all of a long wait's efficiency while guaranteeing a stuck or lost
child is noticed within minutes, not at the end of the session.

### 1. Dispatch the implementer

Record BASE (`git rev-parse HEAD`) before dispatching — the review package
and fix-round diffs need it.

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run this skill's
  `scripts/task-brief PLAN_FILE N` — it extracts the task's full text to a
  uniquely named file and prints the path. Compose the dispatch so the
  brief stays the single source of
  requirements. Your dispatch should contain: (1) one line on where this
  task fits in the project; (2) the brief path, introduced as "read this
  first — it is your requirements, with the exact values to use verbatim";
  (3) interfaces and decisions from earlier tasks that the brief cannot
  know; (4) your resolution of any ambiguity you noticed in the brief;
  (5) the report-file path and report contract. Exact values (numbers,
  magic strings, signatures, test cases) appear only in the brief. Never
  make a subagent read the whole plan file.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief
  (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in
  the dispatch prompt. The implementer writes the full report there and
  returns only status, commits, a one-line test summary, and concerns.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not
  paste accumulated prior-task summaries ("state after Tasks 1-3") into
  later dispatches — a real session's dispatch hit 42k chars of which 99%
  was pasted history. A fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it
  touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- The dispatch carries the no-subagents contract (it is in the
  implementer template): the implementer never dispatches subagents —
  not helpers, and never a reviewer. Review arrives from you, after the
  report. In real sessions, every reviewer a worker spawned duplicated
  the task review the controller dispatched anyway — a full extra
  review seat per task.
- If an earlier task parked a finding in the area this task touches, carry
  a pointer to that ledger entry in the dispatch.
- Record the implementer's agent identity from the dispatch result —
  fix-loop rounds 1-3 resume this agent.
- Never dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts).

### 2. Handle the report

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package (`scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD`, from this skill's directory — it prints the unique file path it wrote; BASE is the commit you recorded before dispatching the implementer — never `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all but the last commit of a multi-commit task), then dispatch the task reviewer with the printed path.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:

1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, rule on the correction, ledger it, and re-dispatch with the ruling carried in the dispatch

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

If the implementer asks questions — before starting or mid-task — answer
clearly and completely, provide additional context if needed, and don't
rush it into implementation.

### 3. Review the task

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the
final whole-branch review. Never skip the task review, and never accept a
report missing either verdict — spec compliance AND task quality are both
required. Implementer self-review never replaces the task review; both are
needed.

- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file: run this skill's
  `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE BASE HEAD` and pass the reviewer the file path
  it prints (or, without bash: `git log --oneline`, `git diff --stat`,
  and `git diff -U10` for the range, redirected to one uniquely named
  file). The output never enters your own context, and the reviewer sees
  the commit list, stat summary, and full diff with context in one Read
  call. Use the BASE you recorded before dispatching the implementer —
  never `HEAD~1`, which silently truncates multi-commit tasks. Never
  dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief
  file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global
  constraints that bind the task.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention
  lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global
  Constraints section or the spec: exact values, exact formats, and the
  stated relationships between components ("same layout as X", "matches
  Y"). The reviewer's template already carries the process rules (YAGNI,
  test hygiene, review method) — the constraints block is for what THIS
  project's spec demands.
- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" or "run race tests
  if useful" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-run tests the implementer already ran on the
  same code — the implementer's report carries the test evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to
  ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a
  false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review
  loop. If the prompt you are writing contains "do not flag," "don't treat X
  as a defect," "at most Minor," or "the plan chose" — stop: you are
  pre-judging, usually to spare yourself a review loop.

The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements
that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the
review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task
complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer
lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec
review — it enters the fix loop with the other findings.

Template: [task-reviewer-prompt.md](task-reviewer-prompt.md)

### 4. The fix loop

The loop triggers when the review reports spec ❌, any Critical or Important
finding, or a ⚠️ item you confirmed as a real gap.

Before the loop starts, two routes leave it immediately:

- Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go
  (`Task <N>: minor (deferred): <one-liner>`), and point the final
  whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed
  before merge. A roll-up nobody reads is a silent discard. Minor findings
  never enter the loop.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with
  what the plan's text requires — is yours to rule on: weigh the finding
  against the plan text, decide with the spec as the binding authority, and
  ledger the ruling before you act on it. Do not dismiss the finding because
  the plan mandates it, and do not dispatch a fix that contradicts the plan
  without a recorded ruling.

Everything else enters the loop. A fix round is one fix dispatch plus one
scoped re-review. Five rounds maximum per task:

**Rounds 1-3 — resume the original implementer.** Send it the open findings
verbatim. Its context is intact: it knows the task, the code, and its own
choices. If your harness cannot send another message to a live subagent,
dispatch a fresh implementer carrying the brief path, the report-file path,
and the findings — the report file is the persistent memory either way.

**Rounds 4-5 — dispatch a fresh implementer on a more capable model** (per
Model Selection), with the brief path, the report-file path, the open
findings, and this framing: "A prior implementer attempted this task
[N] times; you own it now. Read the report file for what was tried." A loop
that survives three resumes usually means the implementer cannot see its
own problem — fresh eyes and a capability bump in one move.

**Every round, either way:** the implementer fixes, re-runs the tests
covering the amended code, appends its fix report to the same report file,
and returns the short contract. Before re-dispatching the reviewer, confirm
the fix report contains the covering tests, the command run, and the
output; dispatch the re-review once all three are present. Name the
covering test files in the fix message — a one-line fix does not need the
whole suite.

**The re-review is scoped.** Run `scripts/review-package PLAN_FILE FIX_BASE HEAD`
where FIX_BASE is the head the previous review saw, and dispatch
[re-review-prompt.md](re-review-prompt.md) with the findings list, the
brief, the report file, and the printed diff path. The re-reviewer verdicts
each finding ADDRESSED or NOT ADDRESSED and flags new breakage in the fix
diff only. New Critical/Important breakage in the fix diff joins the open
findings list. Out-of-scope observations go to the ledger as deferred
minors — they never extend the loop.

**After each round,** append to the ledger:
`Task <N>: fix round <R>/5 (<X> addressed, <Y> open — <finding one-liners>; commits <a7>..<b7>)`

Never fix findings yourself in the controller session — your context stays
clean for coordination, and controller fixes skip review.

**The breaker.** When round 5's re-review still leaves findings open, stop
dispatching. Adjudicate each open finding yourself — you hold the plan and
the cross-task context the reviewer lacks:

- **The reviewer is wrong, or the point is contestable:** park it —
  `Task <N>: parked — <finding> — Ruling: <why the code stands>`. The final
  review sees both sides.
- **Real, but nothing downstream builds on it:** park it the same way, with
  a ruling that says it's real and deferred.
- **Real and load-bearing** — a later task builds on it, or it reveals a
  plan defect: rule on the smallest change that unblocks the dependent work,
  ledger it as `Task <N>: Ruling: <finding> — <what you decided and why>`,
  and carry it into the next task's dispatch. Parking a structural failure
  silently lets every dependent task build on it. Stop only when the defect
  leaves every path forward a guess.

Adjudicate only at the cap. Adjudicating earlier to end a loop is
pre-judging with a different name. Every adjudication is a ledger entry —
a silent discard is forbidden.

### 5. Complete the task

When the review comes back clean — or every open finding is parked with a
ruling at the cap — append the completion line to the ledger in the same
message as your other bookkeeping:

- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`
- `Task <N>: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, <K> parked)` after a
  tripped breaker

Then mark the todo complete and move on. Never move to the next task while
the review has open Critical/Important issues that are neither fixed nor
parked-with-ruling at the cap.

## 7. Spatial consistency — symmetric paths, anchored origins

- **Enter and exit along the same path.** A panel that slides in from the right must dismiss to the right. In-from-right / out-the-bottom feels disconnected and confusing.
- **Anchor interactions to their source.** A menu, popover, or sheet should originate from the element that triggered it — set `transform-origin` to the trigger, so the spatial relationship between button and content is obvious. (This is the same origin-awareness point as popovers scaling from their trigger, not their center.)
- **Mirror the easing on reversible transitions** so the outbound path matches the return path (use inverse cubic-bézier control points for the two directions).

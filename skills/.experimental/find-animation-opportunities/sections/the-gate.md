## The Gate

Every candidate must survive all four questions, in order. Record the answer — it goes in the report.

### 1. Frequency — how often will a user see this?

| Frequency | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette, core navigation) | **Reject. No animation. Ever.** |
| Tens of times/day (hover states, list navigation, frequent toggles) | Reject, or suggest only near-imperceptible motion (fast, subtle) |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts, settings) | Eligible — standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, empty states, success, celebration) | Eligible — this is where the delight budget lives |

Keyboard-initiated actions (command palettes, shortcuts, focus jumps) are a disqualifier, not a judgment call — repeated hundreds of times a day, animation makes them feel slow, delayed, and disconnected. Raycast has no open/close animation; that is the optimal experience.

### 2. Purpose — why does this animate?

The answer must be one of these, named explicitly:

- **Feedback** — confirming the interface heard the user (press scale, hold-to-confirm fill)
- **Spatial consistency** — showing where something came from or went (toast enters and exits the same edge; panel grows from its trigger)
- **State indication** — making a state change legible (morphing button, expanding accordion)
- **Preventing a jarring change** — content that teleports, appears, or vanishes with no bridge
- **Explanation** — motion that demonstrates how a feature works (marketing/onboarding only)
- **Delight** — allowed *only* at the Rare/first-time frequency tier

"It looks cool" is not on this list. If you can't name the purpose in one of these words, reject the candidate.

### 3. Speed — can it stay inside budget?

The suggestion must work within the standard budgets (UI under 300ms):

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

If the moment only "works" as a slow, showy animation, it fails the gate.

### 4. Function — does motion help or hinder here?

Decoration on functional, information-dense UI hinders. A decorative mouse-tracking effect is fine on a marketing page; on a functional graph in a banking app, no animation is better. Data the user is trying to *read* or *act on* should not move for style.

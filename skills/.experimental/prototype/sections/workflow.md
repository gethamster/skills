## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Scope

One thing per run. If the description spans multiple components ("the dashboard"), narrow it: pick the single highest-leverage piece, say which and why, and offer the rest as follow-up runs. Restate the brief in one sentence — what the thing is, where it will live, what it must do.

### Phase 2 — Recon

Before designing anything, map the ground the variants must stand on:

- **Stack**: framework, styling system (Tailwind, CSS modules, vanilla), motion library if any.
- **Tokens**: colors, radii, spacing, fonts, easing/duration variables. Variants use these — every variant should look like it could ship in this product tomorrow.
- **Personality**: playful consumer app or crisp dashboard? This bounds how far the boldest variant may go.
- **Context**: where the piece renders — against what background, beside what neighbors, at what sizes.

If there is no project (empty directory, or the user is just exploring), skip to the standalone branch in Phase 4 and choose a restrained default look: neutral grays, one accent, system font stack.

### Phase 3 — Choose directions

Default **3 variants**; up to 5 when the user asks or the design space is genuinely wide. More than 5 dilutes the comparison.

Before writing any code, list the set: a name and an axis for each. Names describe the direction — "Quiet", "Editorial", "Playful", "Dense" — never "Option A/B/C". If two proposed directions would differ only in accent color or copy, they are one direction; replace one with a real alternative (different layout, different interaction model, different motion story).

**Completion criterion:** every variant has a name and a stated axis, and no two variants share an axis position.

### Phase 4 — Build the picker harness

Two branches, by what exists:

- **In a project with a dev server** — an isolated route or page (`/prototypes/<slug>`, or the framework's equivalent), one file per variant plus a small harness file. Nothing imports from the prototype surface into production code.
- **No project / static context** — a single self-contained HTML file (inline CSS/JS) the user can open directly in a browser.

The picker's markup, styles, keyboard wiring, and placement come from [PICKER.md](PICKER.md), verbatim — load it now and build exactly that. Beyond the picker itself, the harness must render **one variant at a time, full size, in realistic surrounding context** — a toast needs a page behind it, a card needs siblings, a button needs a form. Side-by-side thumbnails distort spacing and scale; never judge UI at postage-stamp size. Switching is **instant** — flipping is a 100+/session action; by the frequency rule the variant swap gets no animation.

### Phase 5 — Verify and hand off

Run the harness. Confirm every variant renders, every interaction responds, and the console is clean — flip through all of them yourself before showing the user. If browser tooling is available, screenshot each variant.

Then present the set and **stop — the choice belongs to the user**:

| # | Variant | Axis | When it's the right choice | Its cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Quiet | Minimal motion, borders over shadows | The product is a daily-use tool | Least memorable |
| 2 | Editorial | Large type, generous whitespace | The moment deserves weight | Eats vertical space |

Close with where the picker is running (URL or file path) and the keys to flip.

**Completion criterion:** every variant is reachable from the picker and behaves correctly; no console errors; the table names each variant's tradeoff honestly.

### Phase 6 — Promote on selection

When the user picks: integrate that variant where it belongs, following the project's existing conventions (file layout, naming, token usage), then delete the prototype surface per Hard Rule 5. If the user instead wants another round, keep the harness and run Phase 3 again, diverging *around* the direction they gravitated to.

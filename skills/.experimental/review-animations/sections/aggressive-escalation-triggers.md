## Aggressive Escalation Triggers

Flag these on sight, hard:

- `transition: all` (unbounded property animation)
- `scale(0)` or pure-fade entrances with no initial transform
- `ease-in` on any UI interaction; weak built-in easing on a deliberate animation
- Animation on a keyboard shortcut, command-palette toggle, or 100+/day action
- UI duration > 300ms with no stated reason
- `transform-origin: center` on a trigger-anchored popover/dropdown/tooltip
- Keyframes on toasts, toggles, or anything added/triggered rapidly
- Animating layout properties (`width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left`)
- Framer Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` props on motion that runs while the page is busy
- Updating a CSS variable on a parent to drive a child transform (style recalc storm)
- Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` handling on movement
- Ungated `:hover` motion
- Symmetric enter/exit timing on a press-and-release or hold interaction
- Everything-at-once entrance where a 30–80ms stagger belongs

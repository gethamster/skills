## How to use this

1. **Identify the task**, not the library the user named. "I need to show a dropdown" is a UI-primitives task (base-ui), even if they asked about something else.
2. **Check what's already installed.** Look at `package.json` first. If the project already uses a listed library, use it. If it uses a competitor (e.g. react-window instead of Virtuoso), flag the recommendation but don't churn the dependency without being asked.
3. **Recommend one library**, state what it's for in one sentence, and install/wire it up if that's part of the request. Don't present a menu of options when the list has a clear answer.
4. If the task isn't covered by the list, say so explicitly and recommend from your own knowledge — but be clear you've left the curated list.

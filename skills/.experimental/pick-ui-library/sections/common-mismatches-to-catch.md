## Common mismatches to catch

- **Toasts built by hand or with a modal library** → Sonner exists for exactly this.
- **A `<div>`-based dropdown/dialog with manual focus handling** → base-ui, which handles accessibility, focus trapping, and dismissal.
- **Animating a number by re-rendering text** → NumberFlow handles digit transitions properly.
- **Rendering a 1,000+ row list directly** → Virtuoso before reaching for pagination hacks.
- **A `useState`-per-component web of props for shared state** → zustand.
- **Template-literal className ternaries three conditions deep** → clsx (or cva if it's variant-shaped).

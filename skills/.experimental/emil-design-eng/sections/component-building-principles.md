## Component Building Principles

### Buttons must feel responsive

Add `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active`. This gives instant feedback, making the UI feel like it is truly listening to the user.

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 160ms ease-out;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}
```

This applies to any pressable element. The scale should be subtle (0.95-0.98).

### Never animate from scale(0)

Nothing in the real world disappears and reappears completely. Elements animating from `scale(0)` look like they come out of nowhere.

Start from `scale(0.9)` or higher, combined with opacity. Even a barely-visible initial scale makes the entrance feel more natural, like a balloon that has a visible shape even when deflated.

```css
/* Bad */
.entering {
  transform: scale(0);
}

/* Good */
.entering {
  transform: scale(0.95);
  opacity: 0;
}
```

### Make popovers origin-aware

Popovers should scale in from their trigger, not from center. The default `transform-origin: center` is wrong for almost every popover. **Exception: modals.** Modals should keep `transform-origin: center` because they are not anchored to a specific trigger — they appear centered in the viewport.

```css
/* Base UI */
.popover {
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}
```

Whether the user notices the difference individually does not matter. In the aggregate, unseen details become visible. They compound.

### Tooltips: skip delay on subsequent hovers

Tooltips should delay before appearing to prevent accidental activation. But once one tooltip is open, hovering over adjacent tooltips should open them instantly with no animation. This feels faster without defeating the purpose of the initial delay.

```css
.tooltip {
  transition: transform 125ms ease-out, opacity 125ms ease-out;
  transform-origin: var(--transform-origin);
}

.tooltip[data-starting-style],
.tooltip[data-ending-style] {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

/* Skip animation on subsequent tooltips */
.tooltip[data-instant] {
  transition-duration: 0ms;
}
```

### Use CSS transitions over keyframes for interruptible UI

CSS transitions can be interrupted and retargeted mid-animation. Keyframes restart from zero. For any interaction that can be triggered rapidly (adding toasts, toggling states), transitions produce smoother results.

```css
/* Interruptible - good for UI */
.toast {
  transition: transform 400ms ease;
}

/* Not interruptible - avoid for dynamic UI */
@keyframes slideIn {
  from {
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Use blur to mask imperfect transitions

When a crossfade between two states feels off despite trying different easings and durations, add subtle `filter: blur(2px)` during the transition.

**Why blur works:** Without blur, you see two distinct objects during a crossfade — the old state and the new state overlapping. This looks unnatural. Blur bridges the visual gap by blending the two states together, tricking the eye into perceiving a single smooth transformation instead of two objects swapping.

Combine blur with scale-on-press (`scale(0.97)`) for a polished button state transition:

```css
.button {
  transition: transform 160ms ease-out;
}

.button:active {
  transform: scale(0.97);
}

.button-content {
  transition: filter 200ms ease, opacity 200ms ease;
}

.button-content.transitioning {
  filter: blur(2px);
  opacity: 0.7;
}
```

Keep blur under 20px. Heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

### Animate enter states with @starting-style

The modern CSS way to animate element entry without JavaScript:

```css
.toast {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
  transition: opacity 400ms ease, transform 400ms ease;

  @starting-style {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(100%);
  }
}
```

This replaces the common React pattern of using `useEffect` to set `mounted: true` after initial render. Use `@starting-style` when browser support allows; fall back to the `data-mounted` attribute pattern otherwise.

```jsx
// Legacy pattern (still works everywhere)
useEffect(() => {
  setMounted(true);
}, []);
// <div data-mounted={mounted}>
```

## CSS Transform Mastery

### translateY with percentages

Percentage values in `translate()` are relative to the element's own size. Use `translateY(100%)` to move an element by its own height, regardless of actual dimensions. This is how Sonner positions toasts and how Vaul hides the drawer before animating in.

```css
/* Works regardless of drawer height */
.drawer-hidden {
  transform: translateY(100%);
}

/* Works regardless of toast height */
.toast-enter {
  transform: translateY(-100%);
}
```

Prefer percentages over hardcoded pixel values. They are less error-prone and adapt to content.

### scale() scales children too

Unlike `width`/`height`, `scale()` also scales an element's children. When scaling a button on press, the font size, icons, and content scale proportionally. This is a feature, not a bug.

### 3D transforms for depth

`rotateX()`, `rotateY()` with `transform-style: preserve-3d` create real 3D effects in CSS. Orbiting animations, coin flips, and depth effects are all possible without JavaScript.

```css
.wrapper {
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
}

@keyframes orbit {
  from {
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotateY(0deg) translateZ(72px) rotateY(360deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotateY(360deg) translateZ(72px) rotateY(0deg);
  }
}
```

### transform-origin

Every element has an anchor point from which transforms execute. The default is center. Set it to match where the trigger lives for origin-aware interactions.

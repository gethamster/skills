## Review Checklist

When reviewing UI code, check for:

| Issue | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Specify exact properties: `transition: transform 200ms ease-out` |
| `scale(0)` entry animation | Start from `scale(0.95)` with `opacity: 0` |
| `ease-in` on UI element | Switch to `ease-out` or custom curve |
| `transform-origin: center` on popover | Set to trigger location or use Base UI's `var(--transform-origin)` (modals are exempt — keep centered) |
| Animation on keyboard action | Remove animation entirely |
| Duration > 300ms on UI element | Reduce to 150-250ms |
| Hover animation without media query | Add `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| Keyframes on rapidly-triggered element | Use CSS transitions for interruptibility |
| Framer Motion `x`/`y` props under load | Use `transform: "translateX()"` for hardware acceleration |
| Same enter/exit transition speed | Make exit faster than enter (e.g., enter 2s, exit 200ms) |
| Elements all appear at once | Add stagger delay (30-80ms between items) |

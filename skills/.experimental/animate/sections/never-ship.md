## Never Ship

Self-check before you finish. Each of these is an automatic block in `review-animations`:

| Never | Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `transition: all` | Name the exact properties |
| `transform: scale(0)` entrance | `scale(0.95)` + `opacity: 0` |
| `ease-in` on a UI element | `ease-out` or a strong custom curve |
| Built-in `ease-out` on a deliberate animation | `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` |
| Animation on a keyboard shortcut or 100+/day action | No animation |
| UI duration over 300ms with no reason | 150–250ms |
| `transform-origin: center` on a trigger-anchored popover | `var(--transform-origin)` (modals exempt) |
| Keyframes on toasts, toggles, rapidly-triggered elements | CSS transitions |
| Animating `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` | `transform` / `opacity` |
| Motion `x`/`y`/`scale` props under load | Full `transform` string |
| Ungated `:hover` motion | `@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine)` |
| Missing `prefers-reduced-motion` | Gentler variant, not zero |
| Everything entering at once | 30–80ms stagger |
